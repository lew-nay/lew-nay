A coursework deliverable for the Autonomous Mobile Robotics module during my MSc degree.

>Goal

Required the creation of a script that could decode incoming serial communication in the form of a binary data file and return a human-readable .csv file.

The code for this decoder can be found <a href="https://github.com/lew-nay/AutonomousMobileRobotics_CW1">here.</a>

> What I learnt in this

This work was my first experience into serial communication and decoding based on a serial communication protocol. In the course of this work I learnt about how protocols are used in data commuinication and it helped me to further my abilities in Python.
