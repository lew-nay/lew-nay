## A Study of a Single Lidar in Object Detection

Alongside the Robotic Systems Design Project which uses the Lidar shown in this video, my team conducted a study into the suitability for a single lidar to be used for obstacle detection in the scenario that we are using it, on a mobile rover in an unknown environment. I then created the video below to present our findings.
