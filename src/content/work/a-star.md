  Pathplanning Algorithm Implementation

One of the pieces of coursework for the Autonomous Mobile Robotics module during my MSc degree was to create a Python script that implemented the A\* path planning algorithm from scratch without any library imports at all.

My implementation at work can be seen in the video below:

<source src="../../../lew-nay/assets/a_star.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>

The A\* function takes in start and end points and obstacles provided by the user, then visualises the path between those points.

The code for my implementation can be found <a href="https://github.com/lew-nay/AutonomousMobileRobotics_CW2">here.</a>
