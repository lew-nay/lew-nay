  Pathplanning Algorithm Implementation

One of the pieces of coursework for the Autonomous Mobile Robotics module during my MSc degree.

>Goal

Create a Python script that implemented the A\* path planning algorithm from scratch without any library imports at all.

My implementation at work can be seen in the video below:
<video width="640" height="360" controls>
<source src="../../../lew-nay/assets/a_star.webm" type="video/webm">
</video>

The A\* function takes in start and end points and obstacles provided by the user, then visualises the path between those points.

> What I learnt:

This coursework developed my capabilities within Python and my abilities in programming generally, especially due to the restriction of no external library imports allowed, so all logic within the algorithm is my own.

The code for my implementation can be found <a href="https://github.com/lew-nay/AutonomousMobileRobotics_CW2">here.</a>
