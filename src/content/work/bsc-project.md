## An Investigation into Gallium Lanthanum Sulfide as a Solid-state Electrolyte

In my final year project I fabricated devices using gallium lanthanum sulfide (GaLaS) as a solid-state electrolyte (SSE),
with indium tin oxide and aluminium electrodes, via thin-film deposition. Differing amounts of Li2S were co-evaporated
with the GaLaS and their electrical properties were investigated via voltage sweeps and impedance
sweeps, from a control result of 10^-13 S cm^-1
the highest conductivity observed in this investigation
was of 10^-6 S cm^-1 and based upon bandgap calculations and electrochemical impedance analysis it is
assumed that the conduction mechanism was via ionic conduction, showing great potential for GaLaS
as an SSE as this conductivity was achieved at relatively low concentrations of Li (maximum conductivity achieved at approximately 52.4% Li2S in the conduction layer).

> Overall Success

At the time of my project, there was very little previous research into GaLaS as a solid-state electrolyte, in my research, I demonstrated that GaLaS is an exciting potential candidate for use as a solid-state electrolyte in future energy storage use-cases. Particularly showing its large increases in conductivity at low lithium content compared to the current state-of-the-art solid state electrolytes.
