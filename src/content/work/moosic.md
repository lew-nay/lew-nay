## Moosic: The Discord Music Bot

> Why?

When mainstream options became unavailable, I decided to create my own Discord Music bot for personal use, as I still wanted this availability and I saw it as a good opportunity to develop abilities in TypeScript.

> Capabilities

Moosic has the ability to stream music from YouTube, Spotify and SoundCloud, including both individual songs or playlists, all integrated into a Discord bot, which can be controlled both via Discord's integrated / (slash) commands, and also via parsing messages in the server it is in, with a starting key denoting the start of a command to the bot.

The full code of Moosic can be found <a href="https://github.com/lew-nay/Moosic">here.</a>
