### Autonomous Object-retrieval Rover

Running for semester 1 and 2 of my MSc Robotics degree, I was a part of a four person team tasked with the design, manufacture and demonstration of a fully autonmous robot.

> Goals

The goal of the project was to create a fully autonomous robot, based on the <a href="https://www.leorover.tech/the-rover">LeoRover</a> platform.

The completed robot was to be capable of:

- Autonomous navigation
- Mapping
- Object recognition
- Object grasping

> My Responsibilties

In this project, I was responsible for the autonomous navigation and mapping capability of the robot.

By the end of the project, the robot was capable of SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping) and exploration of an unknown environment, I accomplished this via the integration of multiple ROS2 packages and bespoke code.

The full codebase of the project, including both my own and my three teammate's contributions, is available <a href="https://github.com/lew-nay/RoboticsSystemsDesignProject">here.</a>

> What did I learn?

In this project, I developed my ability across the ROS2 framework, developed my ability in Python and systems integration, my modelling ability in Fusion as I designed the mounting apparatus for all parts of the completed robot. I was also responsible for the report writing in my team allowing me to develop my ability in LaTeX.
