                <p>
                    I am a current postgraduate student at the University of Manchester studying MSc Robotics, and I completed my Bachelor's degree in Physics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I hope to be able to take the knowledge and skills I've acquired in my studies and apply them into my future career.

            <div class="content">
                With my background in physics and my current work in robotics, my main research areas of interest are in novel locomotion for robot systems
                in reduced gravity environments and on improving the autonomous capabilities of robotic systems to reduce the need for human operation in 
                scenarios such as space exploration where latency between human operators and the robot makes teleoperation difficult.

                <p>Currently studying for my MSc in Robotics. 
                    I am developing my skills across the field of robotics. In this degree I have developed my ability
                    across a suite of different skills.
                    In the course of this degree I have developed my ability within the ROS2 suite with Python and developed my mathematical abilities
                    and understanding across multiple modules. 
                </p>
                <p> Modules completed in this degree:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Autonomous Mobile Robotics</li>
                        <li>Cognitive Robotics and Computer Vision</li>
                        <li>Foundations of Machine Learning</li>
                        <li>Robotic Manipulators</li>

                <p>
                    In my BSc I achieved First Class Honours and gained an understanding across a breadth of different aspects of physics. 
                    I particularly enjoyed modules focused on nuclear physics and undertook optional modules on astrophysics & planetary physics and hope to use the knowledge from this in my future career.
